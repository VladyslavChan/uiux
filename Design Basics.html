            <h2>Theory</h2>
             <p>Design basics are the foundational principles that guide the creation of aesthetically pleasing and functional interfaces. Understanding these principles is crucial for any UI/UX designer because they influence how users perceive and interact with digital products.</p>
            <h3>1. Composition</h3>
            <p>Composition refers to how elements are organized on the screen to create a harmonious and balanced structure. It involves considering the placement of objects, their sizes, spacing, and relationships between them. Good composition makes it easier for users to process information and navigate the interface. Principles like symmetry, asymmetry, contrast, and focusing attention on key elements create visual appeal and enhance user experience.</p>
            <h3>2. Color Theory</h3>
            <p>Color plays a pivotal role in design, as it influences emotions and brand perception. Understanding how colors interact with one another and how they can highlight or conceal elements is essential. Color theory includes aspects like contrast, color harmony, and using color palettes to create the desired mood or atmosphere. For example, blue evokes trust, while red grabs attention. By using colors strategically, designers can guide user behavior and convey messages effectively.</p>
            <h3>3. Typography</h3>
             <p>Typography is the art of using fonts, their sizes, and line spacing to enhance readability and visual appeal. Well-chosen typography not only makes an interface more attractive but also improves the user’s experience by making content easier to read. It’s important to consider font types, styles, and alignment when designing text elements. Good typography can help create a clear hierarchy, improving the flow of information and making it more digestible for the user.
            In summary, mastering these design fundamentals—composition, color theory, and typography—ensures the creation of aesthetically pleasing, functional, and user-friendly interfaces. These principles form the foundation of great UI/UX design and contribute to a seamless and engaging user experience.</p>
